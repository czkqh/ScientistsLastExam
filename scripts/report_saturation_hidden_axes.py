"""Is a task called saturated actually finished, or only finished on the axis anyone can see?

`combined_score` is the only score a searcher receives. Robustness, mechanism recovery and every
per-instance metric are evaluator-only by the visibility contract - deliberately, so a searcher
cannot optimise them directly. The consequence for the saturation verdict is that it is computed
from the one number the searcher was steering by, and it says nothing about the axes the searcher
never saw.

That matters because saturation is what retires a task. `CalorimeterDesign` reads 1.0121 at a
single proposal, above its reference witness, and is classified `saturated_on_ramp`. Re-evaluating
that same candidate shows `robustness_score` of exactly 0.0 on every instance - its worst-shift
utility sits at the *shipped baseline*. The searcher beat the witness on the visible axis and
gained nothing at all on the hidden one. Retiring the task on that evidence would discard a task
half of which is untouched.

This re-evaluates the best recorded candidate for each task and reports what the hidden axes say.
It cannot be read off the recorded trajectory: the visibility filter strips those metrics before
they are written, which is the whole point, so the candidate has to be scored again.
