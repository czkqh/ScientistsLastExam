"""Report each task against the two-part admission criterion, and where the evidence is missing.

A task earns its place in this benchmark by measuring iterative improvement. That takes two
things, and the order matters:

    1. necessary   the open-loop control must SATURATE with budget. A control that keeps climbing
                   means best-of-N is not exhausted over the measured budget range.
                   This is an admission policy, not a proof about asymptotic performance.
    2. sufficient  with best-of-N exhausted, the feedback arm must still beat it, and the gap
                   must widen with budget rather than close.

The sign of condition 1 is the opposite of what it first looks like, and an earlier version of
this script had it backwards. The evidence is in the repository: the decoder's open-loop control
is flat from budget 5 onward and its feedback arm pulls further ahead the longer it runs, while
the molecular task's control climbs 0.404 to 0.970 and its gap crosses zero near budget 7.8.
Refining beats redrawing precisely where redrawing has stopped paying.

A saturated control is not the same as a solved task: `floor` (the control never leaves zero) is
reported separately, because nothing can be measured there either way.

Condition 2 needs paired runs - the same task, same budget, `selection_blind` against `normal`.
Most tasks in this inventory have never had them, and this report says so rather than inferring a
verdict from the one arm that exists. "unknown" here is a statement about the evidence, not about
the task.

# Why the comparability key is `task_package_sha256` and not `task_contract_sha256`.
#
# Both are recorded in every manifest. The contract hash is narrower - Task.md, the initial
# program, verification/evaluator.py and the eval metadata - and it is tempting as the key,
# because it would not reject a comparison over a task whose only change was a note in its card.
#
# It is too narrow for this job. It does not cover the rest of verification/: the reference
# implementations and frozen data that several tasks recompute their anchor from at scoring time.
# Editing RNAEnsembleDesign's reference designer changes what a score means without moving the
# contract hash at all.
#
# The two failure modes are not symmetric. Rejecting a comparison that would have been valid
# costs a comparison and says so out loud. Accepting one that is not valid puts a task change
# into a report as a model difference, which is the error this whole guard exists to prevent -
# on one task it read as an eighteen-fold gap. So the broader hash wins.
#
# Measured, in case the narrower one ever looks tempting again: on this inventory the two agree
# exactly. The same 20 of 54 tasks carry more than one version under either hash, so nothing is
# currently being rejected that the contract hash would have allowed.
